# Custom-Floodlight-Loop
This was used to trigger floodlights for multiple products purchased in a single transaction. The rule lives in Adobe Launch, and the code is activated on a direct call rule being triggered by developers.

The use case provided by the advertising team was the ability to count each purchased product, instead of a singular floodlight event being triggered on the event of a transaction taking place.
